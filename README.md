# AssetIQ 

AssetIQ is a novel, real-time asset valuation system for smart connected devices. It combines ensemble forecasting, dynamic self-correction, advanced jump-diffusion (Kou's method), and heavy-tailed volatility adjustment (GARCH with Student's t-distribution) to provide highly accurate predictions.

## Features
- Ensemble of ARIMA, Prophet, and Random Forest with exogenous indicators.
- Self-correction based on recent historical changes.
- Advanced jump-diffusion adjustment for market shocks.
- Dynamic volatility adjustment using a heavy-tailed GARCH model.
- RESTful API service using FastAPI.
- Containerized deployment with Docker and Kubernetes ready.
